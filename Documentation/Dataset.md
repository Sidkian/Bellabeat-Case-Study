* MET = A MET is a ratio of your working metabolic rate relative to your resting metabolic rate. One MET is the energy you spend sitting at rest.
* All MET values are multiplied by 10. Divide by 10 to get accurate MET values
* Sleep Value indicates the sleep state. 1 = asleep, 2 = restless, 3 = awake
