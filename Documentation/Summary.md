# Summary

From the analysis we can summarize the key findings as follows:

## Activity:

* On average, users tend to cover less than 10 Km or 15000 steps on any given day
* Average Calories burned by a user on any given day ranges between 1000 and 3000
* Users don't walk the recommended amount of steps everyday, which is 10000. Sundays recorded the least number of steps. 
* Users are active between 8am and 7pm. User cover more steps during 12pm-2pm and 5pm-7pm. During Weekends more steps are covered between 10am-3pm
* Majority of the users are in the Good MET Minute range. Only 15% are in the Best MET Minute range and 36% are in the Extra MET minute range

## Sleep:
* There is a negative correlation between Total Minutes Asleep and Sedentary Minutes. This mean that the lesser the person sleeps the more likely they are to be sedentary and feel lazier that day
* On average users sleep 384 minutes or 6.4 hours and It takes them an average of 6 minutes to fall asleep. We see that there is not a lot of difference in the distribution of sleep type based on Good and Bad Sleep. 
* The recommended hours of sleep for an adult is 7 hours or more. Sundays have recorded most amount of sleep time.

## Usage:
* Most of the users use their device for more than 21 days (88%)
* We see that a little more than half of the users (57%) use their device all day
* High Use users wear their device all day about half of the times. Moderate Use users and Low Use users wear it all day about 75% of the time.

# Recommendation

Based on our analysis, we must incorporate the following features in our marketing strategy:

1. To improve activity levels and help users reach their goals, Bellabeat app must be promoted as a fitness aid. It not only tracks daily activity but also creates visuals to check progress. As we can see from the activity analysis, users don't complete 10000 steps daily and stay in the 'Good' MET Minute range. To improve fitness, users must be motivated through frequent reminders and possible rewards on progress completion. Reminders can be set up for lunch hours (12pm-2pm) and after work (5pm-7pm) to get some steps in. Reminders to get a workout in on weekends should push users from 'Good' to 'Best' MET minute range. Also, rewarding users on completion of certain goals with a free trial of premium features or discounts on bellabeat products can enable marketing of other products as well.

    Recommendations for Bellabeat app:
    * Bellabeat app must be promoted as a fitness aid
    * Reminders to walk/workout during known activity hours
    * Rewarding users on completion of goals

2. From the sleep analysis, we concluded that when users don't get in a good nights sleep they record more sedentary minutes or feel lazier. This means getting recommended hours of sleep is essential to staying active during the day. The Bellabeat app can track sleep logs and provide insights into users sleeping habits. Just like activity reminders Bellabeat app can provide sleep reminders to remind users to start winding down and sleep so that they get enough rest in for the next day. The app can record hours of sleep and recomend nap times during the day if the users don't complete 7 hours of sleep.
 
    Recommendations for Bellabeat app:
    * Reminders to sleep on time to cover atleast 7 hours of sleep
    * Reminders to take naps to cover sleep

3. From the usage analysis, we see that even with 'High Use' users, half of them don't wear it all day. This can be because users don't wear their trackers when they are not activitly working out or they need to charge the tracker. The leaf can definelty tackle this usage issue as it is built to be worn 24/7. It is a beautiful piece of jewlery which can be worn in any setting, be it at office or during workouts. It is water resistant and shower safe and hence doesn't need to be removed anytime during the day. It also has a 6 month battery life so it doesn't need to be charged. Promoting this features of the leaf can tackle low usage problems within fitness tracker users.

    Recommendations for Leaf:
    * Battery Life of 6 months which means no charging required
    * Water resistant and shower safe which means it doens't need to be taken off
    * Jewelry-like design makes it ideal for any setting
